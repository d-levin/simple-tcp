DESCRIBE YOUR CODE AND DESIGN DECISIONS HERE

This project implements a "Simple" Transport Control Protocol (STCP) that mimics
actual TCP by providing the services listed below. Since this is a simplified version,
not all functionalities of pure TCP are supported.

-- Implemented --
1. Sliding Window(s)
  - Fixed size: 3072 bytes
  - A receive window
  - A sender window = min(receive window, congestion window)
2. TCP segment send/receive
3. Connection Setup/Teardown

-- Not implemented --
1. Congestion Control
2. Since a reliable network layers is assumed, timeouts, packet loss, and
reordering of packets are not supported.

-- Files of Interest --
transport.h :
transport.c : Full implementation of STCP
sctp_api.h : API utilized by STCP to communicate with the Network layer
stcp_api.c : API utilized to communicate with the Application Layer
mysock_impl.h : Data Structure per STCP connection state (mysock_context_t)


-- Imposed Barriers --
1. Project can not call any function in mysock.h/c
